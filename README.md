# Response datasets

This is a database of responses, aiming at providing data to estimate psychometric models, e.g. IRT and Factor models. Contributions may contain responses from many sources, which include but are not restricted to students, quiz participants and ML models. We accept and encourage responses of many types, such as binary, probabilistic, open-ended (e.g. point counts or error counts), etc.
